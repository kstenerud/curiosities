INTRODUCTION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
A few years ago, a friend of mine gave me his PC Engine.  I soon became
obsessed with the thing and gradually acquired a Turbo Duo and a Turbo Express
(as well as tonnes of games).  The only problem was that all my games were
the japanese hucards, which didn't work in the american systems without some
sort of converter unit, which I promptly bought.
I soon learned to hate the thing since it would crash my game at the slightest
nudge of the game converter (Very annoying since I liked to use my Turbo
Express).  I soon became so frustrated that I took apart the game converter,
found out what it did, and made a switch that would do it instead.
MUCH BETTER!
Anyway, if you hate the TV Game converter thingy for playing japanese hucards,
and you know a little about electronics, this text is for you!



THE THEORY:
~~~~~~~~~~
  All the TV Game Converter actually does is switch 8 pins like so:

View the hucard connector so that the pins face towards you and the hucard
socket faces away:


                                  #     #  hucard socket unit
                                  #     #  (top view)
                                  #     #
                                  #######
                                  #######
                                  ||||||| <- pins

* these pins go straight through

Note: the TV Game Converter has 2 extra pins on each side of the pcboard,
      which are not used.  I am not counting these for the pin numbers.

pins: 16 -> 24
      17 -> 23
      18 -> 22
      19 -> 20
      --------
      20 -> 19
      22 -> 18
      23 -> 17
      24 -> 16

  Notice how the pin swapping is almost symmertrical, but not quite.  This
is why you can't plug it into your PC Engine and play american games.
It is, however, symmetrical enough to make our job all that much easier!



BEFORE YOU BEGIN:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Open up your machine.  Unfortunately, american companies like to rake the
   customer big time, and so your machine likely has some strange screws in
   it.  Someone on the turbo mailing list said they know where to get the
   screw bits.  You could just take a phillips or robertson screwdriver and
   try to take them off that way, but you risk stripping the screw heads.
   Once they're off, get some normal screws to replace them.

2. Locate the hucard socket unit.  It should look something like this:

                            #     #  hucard socket unit
                            #     #  (top view)
                            #     #
                            #######
                            #######
                            ||||||| <- pins

3. Find a nice place to put a switch.  On the express, I found that the best
   place is at the bottom of the machine next to the COM port.

4. Decide how big the switch can be and still fit in there

5. Decide how much wire you'll need.  You'll have 16 wires running from
   wherever you decide to put the switch to the hucard socket in parallel.
   This is where ribbon cable comes in real handy.  I just hacked up an old
   SCSI cable.

6. I strongly suggest you find out where to get a replacement hucard socket
   unit in case something goes wrong.



WHAT YOU NEED:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- A turbo grafx, duo, or express (duh!)
- a soldering iron
- solder
- wire cutters
- some thin, insulated electrical wire (I used and old SCSI cable)
- a 8-pole, double-throw switch (is that the right way to say it? I keep
                                 getting them mixed up)

  The switch should look something like this on the bottom:
          1      2      3      4     \     1      2      3      4
        a b c  a b c  a b c  a b c   /   a b c  a b c  a b c  a b c
        ###    ###    ###    ###     \     ###    ###    ###    ###
                                     /
        ###    ###    ###    ###     \     ###    ###    ###    ###
        a b c  a b c  a b c  a b c   /   a b c  a b c  a b c  a b c
          5      6      7      8     \     5      6      7      8
                                     /
        There are 8 individual       \   When you throw the switch,
        "switches"                   /   8 contacts change the 8
                                     \   "switches"

  NOTE: This kind of switch is hard to find (Especially one small enough to
        fit in the express).  I got one at a second hand electronics shop.



LET'S HACK!:
~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Get your switch and solder small pieces of insulated wire, crossing
   "a" on one switch and "c" on the opposite switch like so:

                         1       2       3       4
                      a  b c  a  b c  a  b c  a  b c
                       \  /    \  /    \  /    \  /
                        \/      \/      \/      \/
                        /\      /\      /\      /\
                       /  \    /  \    /  \    /  \
                      a  b c  a  b c  a  b c  a  b c  
                         5       6       7       8

   NOTE: the crossing wires must NOT be connected to each other!

*** STEP 2 IS THE POINT OF NO RETURN! ***

2. Get your wire cutters and cut pins 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24 (NOT 21!)
   on the hucard socket unit (see above, "THE THEORY").
   Make sure you cut at the point where the pin bends down to connect to the
   pcboard, so as to leave enough room to solder a wire to the pin.

3. Get your soldering iron and desolder the connections of the pins you just
   cut from the pcboard.

4. Using the soldering iron and solder, connect the insulated wire from the
   switch to the pins of the hucard socket unit like so:

                 1            2            3            4
             a   b   c    a   b   c    a   b   c    a   b   c
                16l 16h      17l 17h      18l 18h      19l 19h


                24l 24h      23l 23h      22l 22h      20l 20h
             a   b   c    a   b   c    a   b   c    a   b   c
                 5            6            7            8

   where "l" ("low") is on the pcboard and "h" ("high") is on the pins of the
   hucard socket unit.
   ie. terminal "b" of switch 1 connects to 16h, which is pin 16 on the pins.
       terminal "c" of switch 1 connects to 16l, which is pin 16 on the
       pcboard.

                         pins
                          ||
                          \/
    
                "high" -> ++--########   hucard socket unit
                          ||  ########   (side view)
                "low" -> -------------

                         /\   /\   /\
                         ||   ||   ||
                           pcboard

5. Mount the switch in your machine.  I cut a small hole in the bottom of my
   express and mounted the switch using epoxy.

6. Put your machine back together and test it out.  Switch one way for PC
   Engine mode and the other way for Turbo Grafx mode.


Congrats! You now have a pc-engine/turbo grafx switch!
