Draw 1.0 multi-client whiteboard


WHO MADE IT:

Karl Stenerud	- network & server layer
Chris Torrens	- draw commands & user interface layer
Mike Gray	- user interface layer
Cam Mitchner	- draw commands & bridge between layers


WHY:

This was one of our term 4 projects at BCIT in the Data Communications option.


WHAT IT IS:

A whiteboard is a screen that allows a user to connect to another screen on
another machine, draw on his screen, and have what he draws appear on the other
side.


OUR ENHANCEMENTS:

We've made a few enhancements on the basic whiteboard model:

-Multi client conferencing support:
	Up to 5 people can "conference whiteboard" together using 5 different
	machines. Each person's doodles will appear in a unique color to the
	other machines.
	Actually, the network base code supports up to 255 people, but it gets
	hard to distinguish the colors at that point =).

-Floating server with crash recovery:
	Any "client" can act as a "server", so if the server were to go down,
	the remaining clients will re-negotiate who is to take over as the new
	server.
	By default, the first "server" is whoever receives the first connection
	from another client.

-Shapes & text:
	Not satisfied to stick to boring freehnad text, we added things such as
	circles, rectangles, lines, & text.


COMPILING:

Edit the Makefile to your tastes.  In particular make sure to set the right
compiler for your system.  Linux users with lesstif should be able to use the
sgi settings for the Makefile.

now type make


RUNNING:

run draw, click on Options/Connect, connect to someone else who is running
whiteboard.  You will automatically be connected to whoever else they are
connected to.

Use the "colors" menu to select what color your doodles will appear as on your
machine.

Use the "draw commands" menu to select what draw command to do.
Note: the "draw commands" menu for some reason gets changed to "palette"
when using lesstif.
